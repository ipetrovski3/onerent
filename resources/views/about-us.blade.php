                                <p>Â Thank you for your interest for choosing One Rent a Car. </p>

Our goal is to position on the market as a low cost rent a car company. We choose to care about our clients and to follow the world trends and standards. </p>
                                <p>
                                    Basis of our service is maximum quality at affordable prices.
                                    Many drivers choose a long-term rental over other methods of transportation such as buses, and taxi cabs because of the added convenience of having their own personal car.
                                    In addition to this, it can become quite costly relying solely on public transportation.
                                    With the great selection of cheap rental cars from One Rent a Car, you can choose a car similar to your own or try out something completely new. We can also offer you the extraordinary benefit to change the car model from our fleet proposal 2-3 times during your long time rental period. Get to know the area you are in by traveling at your own pace on your own time.
